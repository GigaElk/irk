GameOff 2021 Submission
Theme: BUG

------------------------------------------------

Follows the theme in 3 ways:

1. The main character/hero is a bug.
2. The code is full of bugs.
3. Its a secret. More fun to find out by playing. (When its ready)

## Free Assets

The following free assets are included in the repository, though they are worth picking up for your own projects:

------------------------------------------------

qBasic: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/qasic-198122

Various tools and timesavers for common tasks.

------------------------------------------------

## Paid Assets

All paid assets, or assets I cannot share, used in this project are untracked (sorry). So to get the code to run you will need to either buy the assets or prepare alternatives.

The following assets were used:

------------------------------------------------

Super Platformer Assets: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/super-platformer-assets-42013

The Tile map and pallets for the levels were created using some of the sprites from this asset. 

------------------------------------------------

Editor Console Pro: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/editor-console-pro-11889

This is an optional asset, but worth checking out. Rather than have any effect on the game itself, and therefore not required, this asset upgrades the console in your editor.
